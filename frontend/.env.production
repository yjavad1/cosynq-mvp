# Production Environment Variables Template
# For Railway deployment, we should NOT set VITE_API_URL in production
# This allows our bulletproof API config to use same-origin calls (/api)
# Only set VITE_API_URL if you need to override the default behavior

# VITE_API_URL=  # Intentionally commented out for Railway same-origin deployment
